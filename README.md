This game was phasmaphobia like. It was my first time working in a 2D world.
The idea behind the game is the player is stuck in a mansion trying to collect parts to make a ghost trap, then trap the ghost. 
The biggest feat and my bigest goal was that I wanted to learn how to make a algoithim for an AI that seems smarter than what I had previously made.
I took inspiration from A* algoithim where each point is given a value and the AI will then chose which points have the best value to reach the goal point the fastest.
I also worked hard trying to make the ghost wander on its own to different rooms allowing the player to hear it coming then hide. If the player was spotted the ghost would chase the player and be smart enough to go to the players last seen position.
I wanted to make it so that the player would only be able to see in the flashlight area making everything else dark and scarier but thats where I hit a road block with the roation and then went back to school.
Majority of what you see there was done in a week on a summer vacation in my down time then a little more over the summer.

I never got around to cleaning up my code and putting notes through it (I know better now, that was 2 years ago)
the big success of that unfinished game is really that AI I worked to devlop, that I found to be super fun and interesting and a big feat from that game!
